You will build a 1-page responsive layout with the following sections and specifications:
● Textbox for user to type in the word
● List of retrieved meanings of the word, along with their synonyms, and example of usage,
where applicable. (A word may have one, or a few different meanings, each with their own
synonyms and examples of usage).
● Each meaning or definition is placed in its own ‘card’. Cards are placed below the textbox
for user input of the word.
You will implement a responsive layout as follows:
● Mobile: 1 column
● Tablet: 2 columns
● Desktop: 3 and 4 columns for smaller and bigger screens
